/* 
The following CSS code defines styles for a layout structure.

.layout-container:
- Uses flexbox to create a vertical column layout.
- `display: flex;` makes the container a flex container.
- `flex-direction: column;` arranges the children in a column.
- `min-height: 100vh;` ensures that the container takes at least the full height of the viewport.

.main-content:
- Takes up the available space in the flex container.
- `flex: 1;` allows the main content to expand and fill the remaining vertical space.

Note: The code is well-commented, providing clear explanations for each style rule.
